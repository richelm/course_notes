## Introduction

1. Consider the dataset given by x=c(0.725,0.429,-0.372 ,0.863). What value of mu minimizes sum((x - mu)^2)?

$X_bar$ is the value of mu that minimizes for a dataset.

```{r}
x <- c(0.725,0.429,-0.372 ,0.863)
mean(x)
```

2. Reconsider the previous question. Suppose that weights were given, w = c(2, 2, 1, 1) so that we wanted to minimize sum(w * (x - mu) ^ 2) for mu. What value would we obtain? 

```{r}
x <- c(0.725,0.429,-0.372 ,0.863)
w <- c(2, 2, 1, 1)
xw <- x * w
mean(xw)
```

3. Take the Galton and obtain the regression through the origin slope estimate where the centered parental height is the outcome and the childâ€™s height is the predictor.

```{r}
library(UsingR)
data(galton)
y <- galton$parent
x <- galton$child
yc <- y - mean(y)
xc <- x - mean(x)
sum(yc * xc) / sum(xc^2)
lm(formula = yc ~ xc - 1)
```
