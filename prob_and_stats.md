# Probability and Statistic Notes

**Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.  
**Event**: A subset of the sample space.  
**Naive definition of Probability: number of possible outcomes

$P(A) = \frac{favorable outcomes}{possible outcomes}$  
where A is an event  
assumes finite sample space and all outcomes are equally likely. 

**Counting**  
Multiplication Rule: if have experiment with n posssible

Probability of getting a full house
