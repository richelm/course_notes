## Synopsis  
This report investigates the exponential distribution and compares it with the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The investigate uses means of random iid  variables sampled from the exponential distribution to create a distribution of means that is used for comparison. 


## Simulation    
For the simulation, an exponential distribution having $\lambda = 0.2$ is used. From this distribution, 40 random samples are taken and their average calculated. This is repeated 1000 times to create a distribution of 1000  means.

Using this distribution the following questions are addressed:  
1. How does the sample mean compare to the theoretical mean of the distribution?  
2. How variable is the sample (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution?  
3. Is the distribution approximately normal?  

The R code below takes 40 random samples from the exponential distribution, computes their mean, and repeats this 1000 time to create a distribution of means. The 1000 means are stored variable **mean_distro**,


```{r}
# set seed for reproducibilty
set.seed(201509)
mean_distro <- NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mean_distro = c(mean_distro, mean(rexp(40,0.2)))
```

With this distribution we address the questions. 

**1: Sample mean versus theoretical mean**. For an exponential distribution $\mu = 1/\lambda$. Since the simulation used $\lambda = 0.2$, the **theoretical mean** is $1/0.2 = 5$. The mean of the simulated distribution is:
```{r}
round(mean(mean_distro),2)
```

As can be seen, the sample mean is a close approximation to the theoretical mean. Which is exactly to be expected based on the CLT. This is further illustrated in the histogram below.

**2: Sample variance versus the theoretical variance.** For an exponential distribution, the standard deviation is $\sigma = 1/\lambda$. Again using $\lambda = 0.2$, the variance of the exponential distribution is $(1/0.2)^2 = 25$. 

The Central Limit Theorem tells us that a distribution of averages of iid variables is approximately a normal distribution with mean equal to the distribution mean and variance equal to the standard error of the distribution. The **theoretical variance** is then:
$SE = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{40}} = \frac{5}{2\sqrt{10}} = \frac{5\sqrt{10}}{20}$  

The following R code calculates the theoretical variance and the variance of the mean distribution. As we see the variance of the sample distribution compares closely with the theoretical variance of the distribution.

```{r}
# theoretical variance
round((5*sqrt(10)/20),2)

# distribution variance
round(var(mean_distro),2)

```

**3: Is the sample distribution approximately normal?**

Below on the left is a histogram of a collection of 1000 random exponentials using $\lambda = 0.2$. It certainly does not appear to be normally distributed. The histogram to the right is that of our sample mean (**mean_distro**). It definitely has a Gaussian appearance. The dotted red line indicates the mean. As we can see, it is centered close to the theoretical mean of 5.


```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height = 6}
dat <- data.frame(Random_Exponentials = rexp(1000,0.2))
g1 <- ggplot(dat, aes(x=Random_Exponentials)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, colour="black", fill="lightgreen")

dat <- data.frame(Sample_Means = mean_distro)
g2 <- ggplot(dat, aes(x=Sample_Means)) 
g2 <- g2 + geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, colour="black", fill="lightgreen")
g2 <- g2 + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(mean_distro)),
               color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1)

grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol=2)
```


To illustrate this further, we will take our distribution of sample means (**mean_distro**) and for each mean subtract off $\mu = 5$ and divide by our $SE = \sqrt{25/40}$. This will give us a standard normal distribution of our means. In the graph below this standard normal distribution of our means is compared with the standard normal curve ($\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$). The histogram of means fits quite nicely under the standard normal curve.

```{r fig.width=4.5, fig.height = 6}
nosim <- 1000
cfunc <- function(x, n) sqrt(n) * (x - 5) / 5
dat <- data.frame(x = sapply(mean_distro, cfunc, 40))

g <- ggplot(dat, aes(x=x)) 
g <- g + geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, colour="black", fill="lightgreen", aes(y = ..density..))
g <- g + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(dat$x)),
               color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1)
g <- g + stat_function(fun = dnorm, size = 1)
g
```
