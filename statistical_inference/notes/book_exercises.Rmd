## Overview

Some exercises from *Little Inference Book* by Brian Caffo.

**Exercise 1**  
Consider a uniform distribution. If we were to sample 100 draws from a a uniform distribution (which has mean 0.5, and variance 1/12) and take their mean, $\bar{X}$. What is the approximate probability of getting as large as 0.51 or larger? **364**

```{r}
m <- 0.5
n <- 100
s <- sqrt(1/12/n)

pnorm(0.51, mean=m, sd=s, lower.tail = FALSE )
```
